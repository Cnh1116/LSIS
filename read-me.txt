This is the read me for Carson Holland's LSIS - Linux System Information Script

This script is designed to run LOCALLY on a Linux system and generate an .XML file of the system's information.


EXAMPLE: `python3 linux_system_information_script.py`

At the moment, no arguments needed.

REQUIREMENTS: Linux OS

Note to self: Syntax is very convuluted ... findall regex method is really bad, could've used find, and then .match().
